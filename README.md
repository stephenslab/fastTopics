fastTopics is an R package implementing fast, scalable optimization
algorithms for fitting topic models ("grade of membership" models) and
non-negative matrix factorizations to count data. The methods exploit
the [special relationship][vignette-close-relationship] between the
multinomial topic model (also "probabilistic latent semantic
indexing") and Poisson non-negative matrix factorization. The package
provides tools to compare, annotate and visualize model fits,
including functions to efficiently create "structure plots" and
identify key features in topics. The fastTopics package is a successor
to the [CountClust package][countclust].

If you find a bug, or you have a question or feedback on this software,

## Quick Start

Install and load the package:

```R
remotes::install_github("stephenslab/fastTopics")
library(fastTopics)
```

Note that installing the package will require a C++ compiler setup
that is appropriate for the version of R installed on your
computer. For details, refer to the documentation on the
[CRAN website][cran].

For guidance on using fastTopics to analyze gene expression data, see
the [single-cell RNA-seq vignette, part 1][vignette-scrnaseq-1] and
[part 2][vignette-scrnaseq-2].

Also, try running the small example that illustrates the fast model
fitting algorithms:

```R
example("fit_poisson_nmf")
```

See the [package documentation][pkgdown] for more information.
