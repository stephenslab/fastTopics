Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
Description: Implements fast, scalable optimization algorithms for
    fitting topic models ("grade of membership" models) and
    non-negative matrix factorizations to count data. The methods
    exploit the special relationship between the multinomial topic
    model (also, "probabilistic latent semantic indexing") and Poisson
    non-negative matrix factorization. The package provides tools to
    compare, annotate and visualize model fits, including functions to
    efficiently create "structure plots" and identify key features in
    topics. The 'fastTopics' package is a successor to the 'CountClust'
    package.
