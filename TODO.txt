to do
=====

+ Implement function to "project" samples onto a previously estimated
  F (either F from a Poisson NMF model or from a multinomial topic
  model).

+ Implement KKT-based stopping criterion for fit_poisson_nmf.

+ Prune functions in misc.R, misc.h and misc.cpp that are no longer
  used.

+ Update pkgdown site.

+ Remove files in inst/derivations/diffcount.

+ Implement "t" S3 method to transpose the rows and columns of a
  Poisson NMF fit.

+ Refactor pca_plot, pca_hexbin_plot and tsne_plot code, and the
  redesign interface for plotting embeddings from the L matrix. Also,
  consider implementing umap_plot and umap_from_topics, and allow for
  using UMAP instead of t-SNE in the Structure plot.

+ Implement integrations for Seurat, Signac and/or ArchR.

+ Implement backtracking line search option for SCD algorithm.

+ Update the pkgdown site.
  
+ Create vignette giving more details about the different optimization
  algorithms. (Then simplify the fit_poisson_nmf example.)

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to gene
  expression (single-cell RNA-seq) data, with a focus on visualizing
  the results, and implementing differential expression analysis using
  the fitted topic model.

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to text data,
  with a focus on the different ways to visualize the results.

+ Add CITATION.
