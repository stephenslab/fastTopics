to do
=====

+ Implement function to fit LDA model by initializing with MLEs for
  Poisson NMF or multinomial topic model.

+ Fix labeling of topics in structure plots so that the topic names
  are shown, rather than the topic numbers.

+ Output posterior median as well as posterior mean in de_analysis.

+ Add note of warning to de_analysis docs about "lower" and "upper"
  not updated to reflect adaptive shrinkage step.

+ Update the vignettes.

+ Update pkgdown site.

+ Implement KKT-based stopping criterion for fit_poisson_nmf.

+ Implement "t" S3 method to transpose the rows and columns of a
  Poisson NMF fit.

+ Implement integrations for Seurat, Signac and/or ArchR.

+ Implement backtracking line search option for SCD algorithm.

+ Create vignette giving more details about the differential
  expression analysis.

+ Create vignette giving more details about the different optimization
  algorithms. (Then simplify the fit_poisson_nmf example.)

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to text data,
  with a focus on the different ways to visualize the results.
